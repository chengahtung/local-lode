Sure — here’s a safe, humane, no-nonsense guide for picking up a duck (domestic or wild).

### Quick safety overview (read first)

* **Only pick up a duck if necessary** (injured, in danger, or domestic duck you care for). Unnecessary handling stresses them.
* **Wash hands** before and after; wear gloves if you have them (ducks can carry bacteria like Salmonella).
* **Keep calm and quiet.** Sudden movements or loud noises will panic the bird.

### How to pick up a domestic duck (calm, used to people)

1. Approach slowly from the side at duck level, speaking softly.
2. Move one hand behind the duck’s neck/upper back to gently guide it.
3. Slide your other hand under the duck’s body (breast area) so you’re supporting its weight.
4. Bring the duck close to your chest — hold it snugly but **not** tightly. Keep wings gently folded against the body (don’t press on the chest).
5. Keep its head free. Support, don’t restrain the legs unless it tries to flap or escape.
6. When setting it down, lower it gently and release once its feet touch the ground.

### How to pick up a wild or frightened duck (minimize stress)

1. Don’t chase — move slowly. If possible, corner gently so it can’t run away.
2. If available, **throw a towel or jacket** over the duck to calm and obscure vision (reduces panic).
3. While it’s covered, slide one hand under its body and the other over its back to keep wings tucked.
4. Hold it close to your body, breast to your chest, so it feels secure. Keep movements minimal.
5. Place it in a ventilated box lined with a towel, in a warm, quiet, dark place while you get help if injured.

### Transporting and aftercare

* Use a vented box with a towel; keep it warm and quiet.
* **Do not** try to feed or give water to a stressed or injured duck — you may cause aspiration.
* If injured or behaving oddly (open wounds, shock, inability to stand, labored breathing), **contact a vet or wildlife rehabilitator immediately.** For wild ducks, call local wildlife rescue — they know legal & medical steps.

### Warning signs & extra tips

* If the duck is shaking, bleeding, breathing rapidly, or has a swollen wing/leg — get professional help.
* Avoid handling ducklings unless absolutely necessary; they are fragile and parents may abandon them if overly disturbed.
* After handling, **wash hands and clothing** thoroughly.
