### 🥖 **1. Foods to Avoid**

Many common human foods are unsafe or harmful for ducks.

#### ❌ Dangerous or unhealthy foods:

* **Bread, crackers, chips:** Low in nutrients, cause malnutrition and “angel wing.”
* **Caffeine or chocolate:** Toxic to ducks.
* **Avocado:** Contains persin, which can be deadly.
* **Onions, garlic:** Can damage red blood cells and cause anemia.
* **Citrus fruits (orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit):** Disrupt calcium absorption → weak bones and eggshells.
* **Raw beans:** Contain hemagglutinin, toxic unless fully cooked.
* **Junk food:** Salty, sugary, or oily foods harm the liver and heart.
* **Moldy or spoiled food:** Can cause fatal fungal infections.
* **Alcohol or sugary drinks:** Never safe for any animal.

✅ **Better treats instead:** peas, corn, chopped lettuce, kale, cucumber, oats, mealworms, or duck pellets.

### 🏡 **2. Environmental Hazards**

Ducks thrive in clean, calm, and safe surroundings.

#### ❌ Avoid:

* **Dirty or stagnant water:** Breeds bacteria, parasites, and algae.
* **Wire flooring:** Hurts their webbed feet — use soft bedding (straw or shavings).
* **Slippery surfaces:** Ducks can injure legs easily; provide traction where they walk.
* **Predators:** Dogs, cats, snakes, raccoons — secure coops with fencing and locks.
* **Chemicals:** Keep them away from fertilizers, insecticides, soap, and cleaning products.
* **Extreme heat or cold:** Provide shade in hot weather and shelter in rain or cold wind.
* **Ponds with strong currents or deep sides:** Ducks can drown if trapped or tired.

### 🧍‍♂️ **3. Handling and Social Mistakes**

Ducks are social but easily stressed if treated roughly or isolated.

#### ❌ Avoid:

* **Grabbing by the neck, wings, or legs:** Always lift gently with two hands supporting the body.
* **Chasing:** Causes panic and injury. Approach slowly and calmly.
* **Keeping one duck alone:** Ducks are flock animals — loneliness can lead to depression or poor health.
* **Loud noises or sudden movements:** Ducks get startled easily.
* **Ignoring boredom:** They need space, water, and stimulation (foraging, swimming).

### 🩺 **4. General Health Cautions**

* Don’t let ducks swim in **chlorinated pools** or **soapy water** — use clean fresh water only.
* Don’t give **human medicine** unless prescribed by an avian vet.
* Don’t overcrowd — space reduces disease spread and stress.
* Don’t skip cleaning — dirty bedding and wet food attract mold and flies.
