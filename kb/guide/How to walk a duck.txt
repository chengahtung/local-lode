### Quick safety checklist (read first)

* Only walk a duck that’s healthy, domestic, and used to people.
* Avoid hot pavement, busy roads, aggressive dogs, and large crowds.
* Use a proper small-bird/poultry harness (not a collar) and a lightweight leash.
* Bring water, a towel, and a small box or carrier in case the duck needs a break.
* Wash hands after handling.

### Step-by-step: teaching a duck to walk with you

1. **Choose the right gear**

   * Get a soft, adjustable **duck/poultry harness** (or a very small bird harness). It should support the chest and back and keep wings tucked without squeezing the crop or chest.
   * Use a short, light leash — 1–2 m is enough.

2. **Let the duck inspect the harness**

   * Show the harness and leash while offering treats so the duck associates it with good things.

3. **Familiarize indoors**

   * Gently place the harness on for very short periods (1–2 minutes) indoors. Reward with treats and praise. Repeat several times over a few days until the duck is calm while wearing it.

4. **Practice walking inside or in a fenced yard**

   * Clip the leash on and walk slowly around the house or a secure yard. Let the duck set the pace. Use treats to encourage following.

5. **Short outdoor sessions**

   * Start with 5–10 minute walks in a quiet, enclosed area (backyard, quiet park corner). Keep sessions short and positive. Gradually increase length as the duck becomes comfortable.

6. **Teach following cues**

   * Use a consistent verbal cue (“come,” “walk”) and treats. Offer a bit of food every few steps at first, then reduce as the duck learns to follow.

7. **Watch body language**

   * Relaxed ducks preen, bob their heads, and walk steadily. Signs of stress: frantic flapping, growling/hissing, panting, or freezing. If stressed, stop, remove the harness, and let the duck rest.

8. **Avoid risky surfaces & situations**

   * Don’t walk on very hot pavement (check with your hand), rough gravel, or steep slopes. Keep away from ponds where wild birds are present (disease risk) and from loose dogs.

9. **End positively**

   * Finish each session with praise, a treat, and a calm cool-down. Ducks learn fastest when walking is a predictable, pleasant routine.

### Frequency & duration

* Start with 2–3 short sessions/week (5–10 minutes).
* Gradually work up to 20–30 minutes if the duck enjoys it and stays healthy. Always err on the side of shorter walks.

### Health & legal notes

* Make sure your duck is vaccinated/dewormed per local vet advice.
* Check local rules—some parks may ban livestock or birds.
* If you see limping, breathing problems, or odd behavior, stop walking and consult a vet.

### Alternatives if your duck dislikes harnesses

* Supervised free-range time in a fenced yard.
* Carrying the duck to a safe pond or grassy area in a carrier for supervised exploration.
* Training it to follow you at ground level using treats without a leash in a secure enclosure.
