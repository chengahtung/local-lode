### 🏡 **1. Give your duck a safe and comfortable home**

* **Space:** Ducks need room to roam — ideally, a **secure outdoor area** with grass, shade, and clean soil. A small backyard or fenced pen works fine.
* **Protection:** Make sure the area is **predator-proof** (secure fencing, covered top if there are cats, dogs, or hawks nearby).
* **Dry shelter:** Provide a **clean, dry house** or coop to sleep in at night. Line it with straw or wood shavings and clean it regularly. Ducks don’t like being constantly wet.

### 💦 **2. Provide water for swimming and cleaning**

* Ducks love water — it keeps them happy and healthy.
* Give them a **small pond, kiddie pool, or large tub** deep enough for them to dip their heads and splash around.
* **Change the water daily** or when dirty — ducks make a mess fast!
* Swimming reduces stress, helps with feather health, and keeps them active.

### 🥬 **3. Feed them well (and safely)**

* Use **duck feed or poultry pellets** as the main diet. Avoid bread — it’s not healthy for ducks.
* Add variety with chopped greens (lettuce, kale, peas), grains, and mealworms.
* Give **fresh water** for drinking (separate from the swim water). Ducks need clean water to swallow food properly.

### 🧍‍♂️ **4. Spend time with your duck**

* Ducks are social — they bond strongly with humans or other ducks.
* **Talk to them softly**, sit nearby, and hand-feed treats. This builds trust.
* If you only have one duck, make sure it gets **lots of attention**, or better yet, adopt another duck friend! Ducks are happiest in pairs or groups.

### 🧸 **5. Keep them entertained**

* Ducks enjoy exploring and foraging.
* Scatter small treats or grains in the grass so they can “hunt” for food.
* Offer safe toys like mirrors, small balls, or floating veggies in their pool.
* Change their environment slightly now and then (new objects, paths, or perches) to keep them curious.

### ❤️ **6. Keep them healthy**

* Observe for signs of illness: limping, droopy wings, watery eyes, or refusing to eat.
* Keep their living area clean and dry.
* Provide **shade** on hot days and **extra bedding** in cold weather.
* Regular check-ups with an avian vet keep them in top shape.

---

### 🌿 **7. Let them be ducks**

* Ducks are happiest when they can express their natural behaviors — **swimming, preening, dabbling, and quacking with company.**
* Give them freedom to explore safely and don’t over-handle them.
* Respect their moods — some days they want attention, some days they just want to splash around and nap.
